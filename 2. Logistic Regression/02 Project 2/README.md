## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck

The datasets for this project were taken from the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data'>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</a> Kaggle challenge.

This project utilised only Logistic Regression.

An accuracy score of 0.65071 was achieved for this project.

<br> **Notes:**
* The Notebook Validation Error for plotly seems to be resolved when the notebook is first opened with Jupyter Labs.
* The notebook with interactive plotly charts may be viewed [here]().

## Methods Used
* Logistic Regression
* Custom function definition (to preview dataframes, and to check imputation status)
* Plotly Grouped Barcharts
* Feature Engineering
* Imputation
* Confusion Matrix via Plotly Heatmap
* ROC Curve
