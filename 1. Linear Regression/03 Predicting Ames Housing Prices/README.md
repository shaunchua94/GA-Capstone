## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to investigate features influencing housing prices in Ames, so as to predict housing prices for an unlabelled dataset.

The datasets for this project were taken from the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data'>House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</a> Kaggle challenge.

A Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) score of 0.16906 was achieved for this project.

<br> **Notes:**
* The Notebook Validation Error for plotly seems to be resolved when the notebook is first opened with Jupyter Labs.
* The notebook with interactive plotly charts may be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shaunchua94/Projects/blob/master/1.%20Linear%20Regression/03%20Predicting%20Ames%20Housing%20Prices/03%20Predicting%20Ames%20Housing%20Prices.ipynb).

## Methods Used
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Ridge Regularisation
* Lasso Regularisation
* Cross Validation
* Outlier Treatment
* Missing Data Treatment (Imputation)
* Plotly Visualisation
