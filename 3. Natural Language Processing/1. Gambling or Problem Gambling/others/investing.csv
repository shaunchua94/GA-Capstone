,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,0,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,,public,270,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,270,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

,investing,"Before, you start reading on the main topic, i would like to make an analogy.

The reason World War I started is extensively credited to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

It's assassination is considered the fuse that would light the fire that would culminate in World War I.

Europe had many problems between it's nations before the assassination, things weren't going well diplomatically and there was a huge pressure on aliances systems and so on, it was just waiting to happen and the murder of the archduke just made it possible.

Having that in mind:

The coronavirus was just the fuse that would light the fire to the recession.

Relevant things that were happening before the coronavirus:

1. Corporate profits were already in a recession.
2. Huge piles of corporate debt, we are at the end of a credit cycle, meaning people and corporation will have to spend less to cut back on debt.
3. The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500, for example, had valuations comparable to previous markets just before the crash, like 2000 and 2008.
4. The Fed already wasted almost all of it’s ammo, reducing it’s ability to keep the economy going, the stock market has been relying for years on the Fed to keep the party going, now that they realize they are on their own, investors could finally realize every price is pretty much inflated.
5. Even though interest rates are historically low, the inflation rate is low, even with a low unemployment rate. This definitely means there is some core problems with the economy since it is a clear show of how much pressure the Fed, consumers and the producers are putting to stimulate growth but it’s still lackluster and clearly show signs of contraction.
6. Millennials and Generation Z are becoming more important every year for the economy. They are probably the most indebted populations there are, reducing their ability to consume, work and to defend themselves against a recession.
7. Even though we have unemployment at record lows, Americans suffer from low wages, almost no working rights, and low capabilities to consume since household debt is at record highs (can’t stimulate growth in the economy if all the households are using their paychecks is just to stay afloat and live up to the next paycheck, leaving little room to actually consume).

So, you have that in mind, and also a Bull Market that has been going since 2009, for 10 years, when the average is 8.

So, if it wasn’t coronavirus it would be something’s else, but let’s examine it’s economic impact.

1. The virus will cause a huge supply shock because of low volume of commerce since China is basically on quarantine and the world depends on China to many of it’s goods.
2. On the side of the consumers, you can cut rates as much as you want, but a huge household debt won’t disappear out of nowhere in these lackluster wages workers are given, have that in mind, the virus is another incentive to consume even less.
3. These halts on supply on demand can cause huge problems on corporations that today are up to their eyeballs in debt, failing to pay short term debts, causing a huge death spiral.
4. The outbreak is not even a it’s peak and already caused a huge economic impact that will only get worse.
5. You can't compare virus outbreaks to previous outbreaks. Because the variable (the virus itself) is completely different from previus outbreaks. People keep comparing this COVID-19 with the SARS in 2003 and they compare how the market reacts back then and think things are going fine. In 2003 the world was much less dependent on China commerce, the Stock Market was just beginning it's Bull Market that would end in 2008. Today we are on all time highs and very much depend on China for global commerce, this virus is much more capable of infection than SARS were, meaning it's economic impact is far greater than any outbreak there.

So yeah, I don’t see the next month with good eyes.

Also, one last thing to make things clear:

You don’t do a emergency cut of 50 bps on a national interest rates if you think the economy is strong and have good foundations, you do it because shit is going down fast and the gears of the economy are starting to break down even faster and you are trying to keep it going by cutting the rates.

&lt;p&gt;So, if it wasn’t coronavirus it would be something’s else, but let’s examine it’s economic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virus will cause a huge supply shock because of low volume of commerce since China is basically on quarantine and the world depends on China to many of it’s goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the side of the consumers, you can cut rates as much as you want, but a huge household debt won’t disappear out of nowhere in these lackluster wages workers are given, have that in mind, the virus is another incentive to consume even less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These halts on supply on demand can cause huge problems on corporations that today are up to their eyeballs in debt, failing to pay short term debts, causing a huge death spiral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outbreak is not even a it’s peak and already caused a huge economic impact that will only get worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t compare virus outbreaks to previous outbreaks. Because the variable (the virus itself) is completely different from previus outbreaks. People keep comparing this COVID-19 with the SARS in 2003 and they compare how the market reacts back then and think things are going fine. In 2003 the world was much less dependent on China commerce, the Stock Market was just beginning it&amp;#39;s Bull Market that would end in 2008. Today we are on all time highs and very much depend on China for global commerce, this virus is much more capable of infection than SARS were, meaning it&amp;#39;s economic impact is far greater than any outbreak there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I don’t see the next month with good eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, one last thing to make things clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t do a emergency cut of 50 bps on a national interest rates if you think the economy is strong and have good foundations, you do it because shit is going down fast and the gears of the economy are starting to break down even faster and you are trying to keep it going by cutting the rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I believe this is the largest black swan event anyone alive has seen. It will have dramatic health and market/financial consequences that are vastly undervalued. Below is my rationale for that thesis. 

1. In 2009 H1N1 infected 1/5 of the world population (crazy, right?) due to its airborne transmission characteristic but ended up having a very low mortality rate of 0.02% as humanity’s general influenza antibodies proved very effective. 

2. COVID19 spreads more effectively than H1N1 through airborne transmission and 2x incubation period. Unlike H1N1 influenza, people have no have antibody defense for this strain of coronavirus - hence the novel nomenclature. The purported 1-4% death rate would be the most deadly virus to spread in the last 100 years and tens of millions of people could die. 

3. The virus is insidiously effective because it A) Does not cause large complications/illness in most people so they go about their life and spread continues; B) in the portion of the population it does seriously affect - it is serious serious, with numbers indicating 10ish% of infections require hospitalization and ventilator support. There is no healthcare system on the planet that can accommodate this, the system will get overwhelmed. 

4. The social distancing protocol that China put in place is almost unfathomable. 1.5 billion people have largely not left their apartment in 6 weeks other than to buy food periodically. This is why new numbers are declining but based on 1 and 2 this is just temporary and the virus will inevitably spread again. The virus is incapable of being “contained”. Extreme social distancing a la China might buy time until the 12 month lead time for a vaccine arrives but this would decimate economies. 

5. China style social distancing is impossible outside of China and smaller dictatorships but governments will impose and people will begin self imposing smaller versions. Expect to see March Madness, Coachella, etc all canceled and any business that is able move to work from home. 

6. The economy at the end of the day is driven by end consumer consumption of goods and services, often provided by small mom and pop businesses. Those speaking of a v shaped recovery are non sensical. A drastic month to multi-month drop in cash flow will tip over many of businesses and they will not meet obligations such as payroll. Your neighborhood burger joint can’t fall back on its strong balance sheet and wait for the V/U.

7. 6 will lead to recession and a domino effect through the economy. Where 08 was a top down driven recession this one will be bottom up. It being bottoms up also means it more resistant to the few monetary policy tools we have come accustomed to using. There will be a complete shakeout in the economy as we physiologically grapple with what this virus is going to mean and what things will look like when it is over. Once people start to understand that people they know will die things will get even more panicky.

,investing,"Hey All! So it appears to me that we're in a debt fueled bubble very similar to 2007/8. It's possible a big part of this bubble is that we never properly deleveraged in the first place (wrote down bad or under-performing loans), and instead printed money via QE to re-inflate asset prices in order to make the underlying investments of many banks appear stable when they were not. This supposedly temporary and emergency ""fix"" became the permanent state of the FED's balance sheets when their attempt to unwind caused a substantial downturn in stock prices in 2019. 

We could call this the permanent pump. A situation where either any attempt to lay off the gas by the central banks or a global hiccup (beer virus, could've been a war, could've been a terror event, or drought ) leads to immense deflationary pressures. 

So the stock market and it's continued rise may be seen as the primary way we've come to grade economic success or failure. The problem as I understand it with this state is that stock market success doesn't closely align with the overall success of the people at large. So we have a situation where though 50% of the general population is living paycheck to paycheck or worse slipping further and further into debt, the narrative of the media and what I generally see here is just how fantastic everything is (record low unemployment! record stock prices! rising home costs! etc). 

The most credible argument I've seen is that we've had a sustained demand crisis at the center of our economic life for 40 years or more. And that the policy effected by the government has been almost wholly supply side focused. This has led to further and further imbalances and instability within the system as the only way to increase demand these last 40 years has been via loaning money to people who have little (student loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, etc). This has propped up consumer spending to keep it at the levels that the system requires to continue growing, but only by causing considerable pain (via foreclosure, bankruptcy, financial distress) to the everyday people.  

So if you've read this far thank you! 

Is this argument sound? If you disagree, please provide some resources to study why. If you agree please elaborate as I consider myself somewhat ignorant on these topics. 

If the argument is sound, the actions of the FED appear to me to be increasing the  instability of the overall system to continue inflating asset prices that are based on debts that should in reality be written down. The only way to make those debts sustainable is to decrease the interest paid to maintain them. I understand that debt on a national scale will never revert to zero barring a jubilee, however inflating the debt bubble with no punishment for poor investments seems to be creating perverse incentives where nearly any loan for any purpose can and should be given out with no regard to the return on that investment social, financial, or whatever other critical measure one would choose to apply. I know the old truism that markets can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, but at what point is the entire financial edifice threatened? Is there a true safe haven: or rather can the central banks maintain confidence in their debased currencies? 

The historical comparisons I draw to current events are both the sustained Roman debasement of their currency during the imperial period and the attempt by the French to create the first fiat currency in the 1700s. Both cases involved systems attempting to ride a wave that never crashes to disastrous effect.  In the Roman case to a centuries of systemic unraveling leading to the ""dark age,"" and in the French case to the quick abandonment of the fiat system and the return to the gold standard.

\- Stock Investing for Dummies: Helped me understand how much I could afford to invest and what the key terms and definitions were. The best thing about this book is that you can jump around from chapter to chapter since each specific topic is fairly self-contained with that chapter. Also,  the appendix can point you in the right direction with resources to learn more different brokers and investing books and websites to learn more.

\- Unshakeable by Tony Robbins: An excellent guide on the mindset that you need to have as an investor. It provides several facts that can free you from the fear and anxiety that dominates most people’s financial lives. I really think that this was the book that gave me the confidence I needed to get started with investing because of the amount of factual information about the market that was given.

\- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham: There are 2 chapters in here that will teach you more about being a successful investor than anything else. One on market fluctuations and one on incorporating what he calls a “Margin of safety”, which could help prevent you from losing a lot of money on your investments. Part of the focus of this book is to show you the importance in doing your own research before making any investments.

I highly recommend these and break these down in detail here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4wmcHElQY&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4wmcHElQY&amp;)

,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,0,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,,public,270,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,270,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

,investing,"Before, you start reading on the main topic, i would like to make an analogy.

The reason World War I started is extensively credited to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

It's assassination is considered the fuse that would light the fire that would culminate in World War I.

Europe had many problems between it's nations before the assassination, things weren't going well diplomatically and there was a huge pressure on aliances systems and so on, it was just waiting to happen and the murder of the archduke just made it possible.

Having that in mind:

The coronavirus was just the fuse that would light the fire to the recession.

Relevant things that were happening before the coronavirus:

1. Corporate profits were already in a recession.
2. Huge piles of corporate debt, we are at the end of a credit cycle, meaning people and corporation will have to spend less to cut back on debt.
3. The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500, for example, had valuations comparable to previous markets just before the crash, like 2000 and 2008.
4. The Fed already wasted almost all of it’s ammo, reducing it’s ability to keep the economy going, the stock market has been relying for years on the Fed to keep the party going, now that they realize they are on their own, investors could finally realize every price is pretty much inflated.
5. Even though interest rates are historically low, the inflation rate is low, even with a low unemployment rate. This definitely means there is some core problems with the economy since it is a clear show of how much pressure the Fed, consumers and the producers are putting to stimulate growth but it’s still lackluster and clearly show signs of contraction.
6. Millennials and Generation Z are becoming more important every year for the economy. They are probably the most indebted populations there are, reducing their ability to consume, work and to defend themselves against a recession.
7. Even though we have unemployment at record lows, Americans suffer from low wages, almost no working rights, and low capabilities to consume since household debt is at record highs (can’t stimulate growth in the economy if all the households are using their paychecks is just to stay afloat and live up to the next paycheck, leaving little room to actually consume).

So, you have that in mind, and also a Bull Market that has been going since 2009, for 10 years, when the average is 8.

So, if it wasn’t coronavirus it would be something’s else, but let’s examine it’s economic impact.

1. The virus will cause a huge supply shock because of low volume of commerce since China is basically on quarantine and the world depends on China to many of it’s goods.
2. On the side of the consumers, you can cut rates as much as you want, but a huge household debt won’t disappear out of nowhere in these lackluster wages workers are given, have that in mind, the virus is another incentive to consume even less.
3. These halts on supply on demand can cause huge problems on corporations that today are up to their eyeballs in debt, failing to pay short term debts, causing a huge death spiral.
4. The outbreak is not even a it’s peak and already caused a huge economic impact that will only get worse.
5. You can't compare virus outbreaks to previous outbreaks. Because the variable (the virus itself) is completely different from previus outbreaks. People keep comparing this COVID-19 with the SARS in 2003 and they compare how the market reacts back then and think things are going fine. In 2003 the world was much less dependent on China commerce, the Stock Market was just beginning it's Bull Market that would end in 2008. Today we are on all time highs and very much depend on China for global commerce, this virus is much more capable of infection than SARS were, meaning it's economic impact is far greater than any outbreak there.

So yeah, I don’t see the next month with good eyes.

Also, one last thing to make things clear:

You don’t do a emergency cut of 50 bps on a national interest rates if you think the economy is strong and have good foundations, you do it because shit is going down fast and the gears of the economy are starting to break down even faster and you are trying to keep it going by cutting the rates.

,investing,"I believe this is the largest black swan event anyone alive has seen. It will have dramatic health and market/financial consequences that are vastly undervalued. Below is my rationale for that thesis. 

1. In 2009 H1N1 infected 1/5 of the world population (crazy, right?) due to its airborne transmission characteristic but ended up having a very low mortality rate of 0.02% as humanity’s general influenza antibodies proved very effective. 

2. COVID19 spreads more effectively than H1N1 through airborne transmission and 2x incubation period. Unlike H1N1 influenza, people have no have antibody defense for this strain of coronavirus - hence the novel nomenclature. The purported 1-4% death rate would be the most deadly virus to spread in the last 100 years and tens of millions of people could die. 

3. The virus is insidiously effective because it A) Does not cause large complications/illness in most people so they go about their life and spread continues; B) in the portion of the population it does seriously affect - it is serious serious, with numbers indicating 10ish% of infections require hospitalization and ventilator support. There is no healthcare system on the planet that can accommodate this, the system will get overwhelmed. 

4. The social distancing protocol that China put in place is almost unfathomable. 1.5 billion people have largely not left their apartment in 6 weeks other than to buy food periodically. This is why new numbers are declining but based on 1 and 2 this is just temporary and the virus will inevitably spread again. The virus is incapable of being “contained”. Extreme social distancing a la China might buy time until the 12 month lead time for a vaccine arrives but this would decimate economies. 

5. China style social distancing is impossible outside of China and smaller dictatorships but governments will impose and people will begin self imposing smaller versions. Expect to see March Madness, Coachella, etc all canceled and any business that is able move to work from home. 

6. The economy at the end of the day is driven by end consumer consumption of goods and services, often provided by small mom and pop businesses. Those speaking of a v shaped recovery are non sensical. A drastic month to multi-month drop in cash flow will tip over many of businesses and they will not meet obligations such as payroll. Your neighborhood burger joint can’t fall back on its strong balance sheet and wait for the V/U.

7. 6 will lead to recession and a domino effect through the economy. Where 08 was a top down driven recession this one will be bottom up. It being bottoms up also means it more resistant to the few monetary policy tools we have come accustomed to using. There will be a complete shakeout in the economy as we physiologically grapple with what this virus is going to mean and what things will look like when it is over. Once people start to understand that people they know will die things will get even more panicky.

,investing,"Hey All! So it appears to me that we're in a debt fueled bubble very similar to 2007/8. It's possible a big part of this bubble is that we never properly deleveraged in the first place (wrote down bad or under-performing loans), and instead printed money via QE to re-inflate asset prices in order to make the underlying investments of many banks appear stable when they were not. This supposedly temporary and emergency ""fix"" became the permanent state of the FED's balance sheets when their attempt to unwind caused a substantial downturn in stock prices in 2019. 

We could call this the permanent pump. A situation where either any attempt to lay off the gas by the central banks or a global hiccup (beer virus, could've been a war, could've been a terror event, or drought ) leads to immense deflationary pressures. 

So the stock market and it's continued rise may be seen as the primary way we've come to grade economic success or failure. The problem as I understand it with this state is that stock market success doesn't closely align with the overall success of the people at large. So we have a situation where though 50% of the general population is living paycheck to paycheck or worse slipping further and further into debt, the narrative of the media and what I generally see here is just how fantastic everything is (record low unemployment! record stock prices! rising home costs! etc). 

The most credible argument I've seen is that we've had a sustained demand crisis at the center of our economic life for 40 years or more. And that the policy effected by the government has been almost wholly supply side focused. This has led to further and further imbalances and instability within the system as the only way to increase demand these last 40 years has been via loaning money to people who have little (student loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, etc). This has propped up consumer spending to keep it at the levels that the system requires to continue growing, but only by causing considerable pain (via foreclosure, bankruptcy, financial distress) to the everyday people.  

So if you've read this far thank you! 

Is this argument sound? If you disagree, please provide some resources to study why. If you agree please elaborate as I consider myself somewhat ignorant on these topics.

Anyway, thank you in advance for any insight!",t2_54v4k,False,,0,False,Macro Questions considering FED activity,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,False,t3_few40q,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583621582.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey All! So it appears to me that we&amp;#39;re in a debt fueled bubble very similar to 2007/8. It&amp;#39;s possible a big part of this bubble is that we never properly deleveraged in the first place (wrote down bad or under-performing loans), and instead printed money via QE to re-inflate asset prices in order to make the underlying investments of many banks appear stable when they were not. This supposedly temporary and emergency &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; became the permanent state of the FED&amp;#39;s balance sheets when their attempt to unwind caused a substantial downturn in stock prices in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could call this the permanent pump. A situation where either any attempt to lay off the gas by the central banks or a global hiccup (beer virus, could&amp;#39;ve been a war, could&amp;#39;ve been a terror event, or drought ) leads to immense deflationary pressures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the stock market and it&amp;#39;s continued rise may be seen as the primary way we&amp;#39;ve come to grade economic success or failure. The problem as I understand it with this state is that stock market success doesn&amp;#39;t closely align with the overall success of the people at large. So we have a situation where though 50% of the general population is living paycheck to paycheck or worse slipping further and further into debt, the narrative of the media and what I generally see here is just how fantastic everything is (record low unemployment! record stock prices! rising home costs! etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most credible argument I&amp;#39;ve seen is that we&amp;#39;ve had a sustained demand crisis at the center of our economic life for 40 years or more. And that the policy effected by the government has been almost wholly supply side focused. This has led to further and further imbalances and instability within the system as the only way to increase demand these last 40 years has been via loaning money to people who have little (student loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, etc). This has propped up consumer spending to keep it at the levels that the system requires to continue growing, but only by causing considerable pain (via foreclosure, bankruptcy, financial distress) to the everyday people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;ve read this far thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this argument sound? If you disagree, please provide some resources to study why. If you agree please elaborate as I consider myself somewhat ignorant on these topics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the argument is sound, the actions of the FED appear to me to be increasing the  instability of the overall system to continue inflating asset prices that are based on debts that should in reality be written down. The only way to make those debts sustainable is to decrease the interest paid to maintain them.

I kept seeing everyone around me seemingly making moves with their investments but I had no idea to approach it. Then I decided to start reading more for myself.

\- Stock Investing for Dummies: Helped me understand how much I could afford to invest and what the key terms and definitions were. The best thing about this book is that you can jump around from chapter to chapter since each specific topic is fairly self-contained with that chapter. Also,  the appendix can point you in the right direction with resources to learn more different brokers and investing books and websites to learn more.

\- Unshakeable by Tony Robbins: An excellent guide on the mindset that you need to have as an investor. It provides several facts that can free you from the fear and anxiety that dominates most people’s financial lives. I really think that this was the book that gave me the confidence I needed to get started with investing because of the amount of factual information about the market that was given.

\- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham: There are 2 chapters in here that will teach you more about being a successful investor than anything else. One on market fluctuations and one on incorporating what he calls a “Margin of safety”, which could help prevent you from losing a lot of money on your investments. Part of the focus of this book is to show you the importance in doing your own research before making any investments.

Right now Mr. Market is offering you a 0.85% APR loan that isn't due until 1014 days from now. Selling the box on SPX on 16 DEC 22 will cost you 2.5%. 2.5%/1014 days to expiration * 365 = .85% annualized percentage rate. I got filled for 70k cost on a 2.8 million box spread. 70k/2.8 million = 2.5%.

10% interest rates for a fully secured loan is **usury.** I can balance transfer to my checking account for 3% for a year on my credit card.

# How box spread financing works

https://www.theocc.com/components/docs/about/press/white-papers/2016/box-spreads-options-strategies-for-borrowing-or-lending-cash.pdf

Short the box = borrower.      
Long the box = lender.    

Everyone here remembers GUH. The issue with Robinhood was they added the credit received from box spreads and other option selling premium as if it were a cash contribution. **There is a legitimate use of box spreads though!** However at a real broker say TD Ameritrade the cash is held secure. However it offsets your debit balance! You're no longer paying 10% interest to your broker but to the market!

# Pros and cons of box spreads

Pros:   
        
* Insanely cheap interest rates for margin. 
* No credit check, no application, Mr. Market gives to anyone smart enough to know how to short the box. 
* Fixed due date. Hint: **EUROPEAN OPTIONS.**
* Can pay back the loan at any time,  possibly profiting. 
* Fully and automatically deductible 60%/40% LTCG/STCG tax treatment unlike margin interest which requires you to itemize. 
* Possibly less broker interference with margin calls/more leeway since the loan isn't on their books and isn't due for years. 

Cons:     
     
* Reg-T margin reduces your buying power by the loan cost amount. You need portfolio margin to have access to 100% borrowing. $0 BPR on portfolio margin. 
* Portfolio margin traders can suffer margin calls if you have a bad mark/quote. This is a huge problem at Interactive Brokers. TD Ameritrade seems to be a lot smarter about this. You need to place a GTC close order at a very favorable unrealistic price to always quote your box. 
* Portfolio margin will reduce your equity by the current quoted cost to close the loan. Equity margin call risk with *rising interest rates* even though your interest rate is **fixed.**
* Brokers **hate** box spreads. See mechanics section.  
* Possibly forgetting about your margin debt since your cash balance is positive. 
* Interactive brokers will liquidate legs of the box automatically if margin called lol. Set the box to ""liquidate last"" in TWS.
* Doesn't offset short sale margin interest rates. Internally your broker clearing house lumps options trades + long equity in your margin account so the cash is offset. However you have a *separate* account for short sales of stock. You'll still get hit with 8-10% interest on short sales. Get over to IBKR pronto if direct short selling is your strategy.

# Mechanics of Box Spread Financing 

First: Find a European style 1256 contract eligible index options chain like SPX.

Borrower: Short 1,000 points of SPX = borrowing $100k.       
Lender: Long/Debit 1,000 points of SPX = lending out $100k.      

Type of options trade: COMBO/ Iron Condor option. **You must do all 4 legs at once.**

Limit/Market order: **LIMIT**  If I need to explain why then box spread financing isn't for you. 

Pair up a vertical call spread with a put spread in both the **same** strikes.

Place your combo order and carefully use confirm dialog/ option modeling software to absolutely be sure it's uniform max loss no matter how SPX moves. Start off with the most favorable price you want then slowly work it. Box spreads take time to fill and quote. Lender algorithm trading boxes hunt for them and it takes time for the options exchange to match order flow. It's essentially a shadow auction at the exchange.

**You need to direct route these orders to an exchange.** You can try smart routing first but it seems to work better getting quoted. Direct routing may bypass some limitations your broker attempts to prevent you from getting better interest rates. 

# Wide strikes vs multiple contracts

Obviously less contracts = less commissions. You can think of commissions as a lending charge/etc.

Brokers **hate** retail plebs getting institutional margin rates through the market. I had a lot of trouble filling my $2.8m box in a real account on TOS. TD Ameritrade simply won't send a box order to an exchange if there is no quote. So I had to resort to multiple contracts. 

Multiple contracts near the money = faster fill, possibly at better rates. Simply put there is more action and liquidity at the money. The options exchange software can possibly match your box legs to 4 different traders at the money and fill everyone making everyone happy. *Box spread lending is one reason why the zero sum argument in options trading is bunk.* 4 traders get whatever position they want and internally they're all lending money to you. That's a win/win where both sides profit.

Fewer contracts way out the money = only getting fills from people who **want** to be box spread lenders. 

In my experience I found, while more costly, near the money boxes are much easier and less frustrating to be filled. 

# Conclusion 

I hope learning about box spread financing helps you YOLO even more efficiently.

Edit 2:     
You need a margin account to make use of this. Box spreads DON'T give you leverage (when the broker implements it correctly). You can't use a cash account to borrow on box spreads, only lend. 

Edit:

&lt;li&gt;Reg-T margin reduces your buying power by the loan cost amount. You need portfolio margin to have access to 100% borrowing. $0 BPR on portfolio margin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio margin traders can suffer margin calls if you have a bad mark/quote. This is a huge problem at Interactive Brokers. TD Ameritrade seems to be a lot smarter about this. You need to place a GTC close order at a very favorable unrealistic price to always quote your box. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio margin will reduce your equity by the current quoted cost to close the loan. Equity margin call risk with &lt;em&gt;rising interest rates&lt;/em&gt; even though your interest rate is &lt;strong&gt;fixed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokers &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; box spreads. See mechanics section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly forgetting about your margin debt since your cash balance is positive. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive brokers will liquidate legs of the box automatically if margin called lol. Set the box to &amp;quot;liquidate last&amp;quot; in TWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t offset short sale margin interest rates. Internally your broker clearing house lumps options trades + long equity in your margin account so the cash is offset. However you have a &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; account for short sales of stock. You&amp;#39;ll still get hit with 8-10% interest on short sales. Get over to IBKR pronto if direct short selling is your strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mechanics of Box Spread Financing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: Find a European style 1256 contract eligible index options chain like SPX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrower: Short 1,000 points of SPX = borrowing $100k.&lt;br/&gt;
Lender: Long/Debit 1,000 points of SPX = lending out $100k.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type of options trade: COMBO/ Iron Condor option. &lt;strong&gt;You must do all 4 legs at once.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limit/Market order: &lt;strong&gt;LIMIT&lt;/strong&gt;  If I need to explain why then box spread financing isn&amp;#39;t for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair up a vertical call spread with a put spread in both the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place your combo order and carefully use confirm dialog/ option modeling software to absolutely be sure it&amp;#39;s uniform max loss no matter how SPX moves. Start off with the most favorable price you want then slowly work it. Box spreads take time to fill and quote. Lender algorithm trading boxes hunt for them and it takes time for the options exchange to match order flow. It&amp;#39;s essentially a shadow auction at the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to direct route these orders to an exchange.&lt;/strong&gt; You can try smart routing first but it seems to work better getting quoted. Direct routing may bypass some limitations your broker attempts to prevent you from getting better interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wide strikes vs multiple contracts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously less contracts = less commissions. You can think of commissions as a lending charge/etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brokers &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; retail plebs getting institutional margin rates through the market. I had a lot of trouble filling my $2.8m box in a real account on TOS. TD Ameritrade simply won&amp;#39;t send a box order to an exchange if there is no quote. So I had to resort to multiple contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple contracts near the money = faster fill, possibly at better rates. Simply put there is more action and liquidity at the money. The options exchange software can possibly match your box legs to 4 different traders at the money and fill everyone making everyone happy. &lt;em&gt;Box spread lending is one reason why the zero sum argument in options trading is bunk.&lt;/em&gt; 4 traders get whatever position they want and internally they&amp;#39;re all lending money to you. That&amp;#39;s a win/win where both sides profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fewer contracts way out the money = only getting fills from people who &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to be box spread lenders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience I found, while more costly, near the money boxes are much easier and less frustrating to be filled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope learning about box spread financing helps you YOLO even more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2:&lt;br/&gt;
You need a margin account to make use of this. Box spreads DON&amp;#39;T give you leverage (when the broker implements it correctly). You can&amp;#39;t use a cash account to borrow on box spreads, only lend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR spoon feed me the trade/position&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick to your 10% margin interest rates/ robinhood gold subscription. This isn&amp;#39;t a trade but a &lt;em&gt;financing strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
